      web app that organizes linked open data from physical or digital supply chains into
      authentic stories. Thanks to Devoleum it is possible to notarize the steps
      of a supply chain in an immutable way on blockchains and other distributed
      systems, using cryptographic hashes that allow data verification and a
      high degree of privacy. Each story shows in a clear and detailed way the
      steps that contributed to making the product unique and precious. Here you
      can verify the stories showed on our platform.
